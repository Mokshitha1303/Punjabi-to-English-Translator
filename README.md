# Punjabi-to-English-Translator
This is a model that is built to traslate Punjabi to English and English to Punjabi
<h1>Punjabi to English Neural Machine Translation</h1>

<p>This project implements a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model for translating Punjabi text to English. It leverages an encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanism for better translation quality.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>The model is trained on a parallel corpus of Punjabi-English sentences obtained from the Tatoeba Project.</p>

<h2>Model Architecture</h2>

<p>The model consists of an encoder RNN and an attention-based decoder RNN. The encoder processes the input Punjabi sentence and produces a context vector. The decoder uses this context vector and attention mechanism to generate the English translation.</p>

<h2>Training</h2>

<p>The model is trained using teacher forcing and backpropagation. It is optimized using stochastic gradient descent (SGD).</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>The model's performance is evaluated on a held-out test set using the BLEU score.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To translate a Punjabi sentence, simply pass it to the `evaluate_eng` function.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>The code for the project is available on GitHub. It is written in Python and uses the PyTorch library.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The model achieves a BLEU score of [insert BLEU score here] on the test set.</p>

<h2>Future Work</h2>

<p>Future work includes improving the model's performance by using a larger dataset, more advanced model architectures, and better training techniques.</p>
